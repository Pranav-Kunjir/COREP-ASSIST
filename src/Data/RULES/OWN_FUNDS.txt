CHAPTER 2: DETERMINATION OF OWN FUNDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 A firm’s own funds comprise the sum of its basic own funds and subject to 2.5, ancillary own funds.
[Note: Art. 87 of the Solvency II Directive]
[31/12/2024]

2.2 The firm’s basic own funds consist of the following items:
(1) the excess of assets over liabilities, less the amount of own shares held by the firm; and
(2) subordinated liabilities.
[Note: Art. 88 of the Solvency II Directive]
[01/01/2016]

2.3 Subject to 2.5, the firm’s ancillary own funds consist of items (other than items of basic own funds) which can be called up to absorb losses, including the following (to the extent that they are not items of basic own funds):
(1) unpaid share capital or initial fund that has not been called up;
(2) letters of credit and guarantees;
(3) any other legally binding commitments received by the firm; and
(4) for a mutual, any future claims which it may have against its members by way of a call for supplementary contribution within the next 12 months.
[Note: Art. 89(1) of the Solvency II Directive]
[01/01/2016]

2.4 Where an item of ancillary own funds becomes paid in or called up, the proceeds paid in or the amount due in respect of the call must be treated as an asset and the item must cease to be treated as an item of ancillary own funds.
[Note: Art. 89(2) of the Solvency II Directive]
[01/01/2016]

2.5 When determining its own funds, a firm must not take into account any item of ancillary own funds unless, subject to 2.6, it has received an ancillary own funds permission in respect of that item specifying either:
(1) a monetary amount for the relevant item of ancillary own funds; or
(2) the method by which to determine the amount of the relevant item of ancillary own funds, together with the amount determined in accordance with that method for a specified time period.
[Note: Art. 90(1) and (3) of the Solvency II Directive]
[31/12/2024]

2.6 Where, in respect of an ancillary own funds item, a firm has received an ancillary own funds permission:
(1) that specifies a monetary amount, in accordance with 2.5(1), the firm may only include that item in its own funds up to the monetary amount set out in the ancillary own funds permission; or
(2) that specifies a method by which to determine a monetary amount in accordance with 2.5(2), the firm may only include that item in its own funds up to the monetary amount that has been determined by the method set out in, and only for the time period specified by, the ancillary own funds permission.
[Note: Art. 90(3) of the Solvency II Directive]
[31/12/2024]

2.7 A firm may only attribute an amount to an item of ancillary own funds to the extent that it:
(1) reflects the loss-absorbency of the item; and
(2) is based upon prudent and realistic assumptions.
[Note: Art. 90(2) of the Solvency II Directive]
[01/01/2016]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 3: CLASSIFICATION OF OWN FUNDS INTO TIERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 A firm may only include an own funds item in its Tier 1 own funds if:
(1) it is an item of basic own funds; and
(2) it substantially possesses the characteristics set out in 3.5(1) and 3.5(2), taking into consideration the features set out in 3.6.
[Note: Art. 94(1) of the Solvency II Directive]
[01/01/2016]

3.2 A firm may only include an own funds item in its Tier 2 own funds if:
(1) where it is an item of basic own funds, it substantially possesses the characteristics set out in 3.5(2), taking into consideration the features set out in 3.6; or
(2) where it is an item of ancillary own funds, it substantially possesses the characteristics set out in 3.5(1) and 3.5(2), taking into consideration the features set out in 3.6.
[Note: Art. 94(2) of the Solvency II Directive]
[01/01/2016]

3.3 A firm may only include in its Tier 3 own funds an item of:
(1) basic own funds that does not fall within 3.1 or 3.2(1); and
(2) ancillary own funds that does not fall within 3.2(2).
[Note: Art. 94(3) of the Solvency II Directive]
[01/01/2016]

3.4 (1) In classifying its own funds items, a firm must refer to the own funds lists.
(2) A firm must not include an own funds item in its Tier 1 own funds, Tier 2 own funds or Tier 3 own funds if that own funds item is not covered by the own funds lists, unless it has received a classification of own funds permission in respect of that item.
(3) [Deleted]
[Note: Art. 95 of the Solvency II Directive]
[31/12/2024]

3.4A Notwithstanding that a firm has received a classification of own funds permission, basic own funds items not included in the own funds lists may only be classified as Tier 1 own funds where they are fully paid in.
[31/12/2024]

3.5 The characteristics referred to in 3.1(2) and 3.2 are:
(1) the item is available, or can be called up on demand, to fully absorb losses on a going-concern basis as well as in the case of winding up (permanent availability); and
(2) in the case of winding up, the total amount of the item is available to absorb losses and the repayment of the item is refused to its holder until all other obligations, including insurance and reinsurance obligations to policyholders, have been met (subordination).
[Note: Art. 93(1) of the Solvency II Directive]
[01/01/2016]

3.6 When assessing the extent to which own funds items possess the characteristics set out in 3.5, currently and in the future, a firm must consider:
(1) the duration of the item, in particular whether the item is dated or not and, where an own funds item is dated, the relative duration of the item as compared to the duration of the insurance and reinsurance obligations of the firm (sufficient duration);
(2) whether the item is free from requirements or incentives to redeem the nominal sum (absence of incentives to redeem);
(3) whether the item is free from mandatory fixed charges (absence of mandatory servicing costs); and
(4) whether the item is clear of encumbrances (absence of encumbrances).
[Note: Art. 93(2) of the Solvency II Directive]
[01/01/2016]

3.7 (1) A firm must not classify as Tier 1 own funds:
(a) paid-in ordinary share capital and related share premium account; or
(b) paid-in initial fund, member’s contribution or the equivalent basic own funds for a mutual
unless the firm has the right to cancel and withhold dividends or other distributions in respect of those items at any time prior to payment, (and exercises that right) in the circumstances specified in 3B.1(12).
(2) A firm must not classify as Tier 2 basic own funds:
(a) ordinary share capital and related share premium account; or
(b) initial fund, member’s contribution or the equivalent basic own funds for a mutual
unless the firm has the right to defer dividends or other distributions in respect of those items at any time prior to payment, (and exercises that right) in the circumstances specified in 3E.1(8).
[Note: Art. 93 and Art. 94 of the Solvency II Directive]
[31/12/2024]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(15) the basic own funds item is free from encumbrances and is not connected with any other transaction, which when considered with the basic own funds item, could result in that basic own funds item not complying with 3.1.
[31/12/2024]

3B.2 For the purposes of 3B, the exchange or conversion of a basic own funds item into another Tier 1 own funds item or the repayment or redemption of a Tier 1 own funds item out of the proceeds of a new basic own funds item of at least the same quality will not be deemed to be a repayment or redemption, provided that the exchange, conversion, repayment or redemption is subject to receiving prior permission from the PRA.
[31/12/2024]

3B.3 For the purposes of 3B.1(14), in the case of basic own funds items referred to in 3A.1(1)(a) and 3A.1(1)(b), the item provides full flexibility over distributions only where all of the following conditions are met:

[31/12/2024]

3B.5 For the purposes of 3B.1(5)(a), the nominal or principal amount of the basic own funds item must be written down in such a way that all of the following are reduced:
(1) the claim of the holder of that item in the event of winding-up proceedings;
(2) the amount required to be paid on repayment or redemption of that item; and
(3) the distributions paid on that item.
[31/12/2024]

3B.6 For the purposes of 3B.1(5)(a), the provisions governing the write-down of the nominal or principal amount of the basic own funds item must provide for all of the following:
(1) if the trigger event specified in 3B.10 has occurred in the circumstances described in 3B.10(3) and a partial write-down would be sufficient to re-establish compliance with the SCR, there is a partial write-down of the nominal or principal amount for an amount that is at least sufficient to re-establish compliance with the SCR;
(2) if the trigger event specified in 3B.10 has occurred in the circumstances described in 3B.10(3) and a partial write-down would not be sufficient to re-establish compliance with the SCR, the nominal or principal amount as determined at the time of original issuance of the basic own funds item is written down at least on a linear basis in a manner which ensures that full write-down will occur when 75% coverage of the SCR is reached, or prior to that event;
(3) if the trigger event specified in 3B.10 has occurred in the circumstances described in 3B.10(1) or 3B.10(2), the nominal or principal amount is written down in full; and
(4) following a write-down in accordance with 3B.6(2) ('the initial write-down'):
(a) if the trigger event specified in 3B.10 subsequently occurs in the circumstances described in 3B.10(1) or 3B.10(2), the nominal or principal amount is written down in full;
(b) if, by the end of the period of three months from the date of the trigger event that resulted in the initial write-down, no trigger event has occurred in the circumstances described in 3B.10(1) or 3B.10(2) but the solvency ratio has deteriorated further, the nominal or principal amount as determined at the time of original issuance of the basic own funds item is written down further in accordance with 3B.6(2) to reflect that further deterioration in the solvency ratio; and
(c) a further write-down is made in accordance with 3B.6(4)(b) for each subsequent deterioration in the solvency ratio at the end of each subsequent period of three months until the firm has re-established compliance with the SCR.
For the purposes of 3B.6(4), the 'solvency ratio' means the ratio of eligible own funds (to cover a firm’s SCR) and the firm’s SCR using the latest available values.
[31/12/2024]

3B.7 For the purposes of 3B.1(5)(b), the provisions governing the conversion into basic own funds items listed in 3A.1(1)(a) or 3A.1(1)(b) must specify either of the following:
(1) the rate of conversion and a limit on the permitted amount of conversion; or
(2) a range within which the instruments will convert into the basic own funds item listed in 3A.1(1)(a) or 3A.1(1)(b).
[31/12/2024]

3B.8 For the purposes of 3B.1(5)(b), the provisions governing the conversion into basic own funds items listed in 3A.1(1)(a) or 3A.1(1)(b) must provide for all of the following:
(1) if the trigger event specified in 3B.10 has occurred in the circumstances described in 3B.10(3) and a partial conversion would be sufficient to re-establish compliance with the SCR, there is a partial conversion of the item for an amount that is at least sufficient to re-establish compliance with the SCR;
(2) if the trigger event specified in 3B.10 has occurred in the circumstances described in 3B.10(3) and a partial conversion would not be sufficient to re-establish compliance with the SCR, the item is converted in such a way that the remaining nominal or principal amount of the item decreases at least on a linear basis ensuring that full conversion will occur when 75% coverage of the SCR is reached, or prior to that event;
(3) if the trigger event specified in 3B.10 has occurred in the circumstances described in 3B.10(1) or 3B.10(2), the item is converted in full; and
(4) following a conversion in accordance with 3B.8(2) ('the initial conversion'):
(a) if the trigger event specified in 3B.10 subsequently occurs in the circumstances described in 3B.10(1) or 3B.10(2), the item is converted in full;
(b) if, by the end of the period of three months from the date of the trigger event that resulted in the initial conversion, no trigger event has occurred in the circumstances described in 3B.10(1) or 3B.10(2) but the solvency ratio has deteriorated further, the item is converted further in accordance with 3B.8(2) to reflect that further deterioration in the solvency ratio; and
(c) a further conversion is made in accordance with 3B.8(4)(b) for each subsequent deterioration in the solvency ratio at the end of each subsequent period of three months until the firm has re-established compliance with the SCR.
For the purposes of 3B.8(4), the 'solvency ratio' has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of 3B.6.
[31/12/2024]

3B.9 The nominal or principal amount of the basic own funds item must absorb losses at the trigger event. Loss absorbency resulting from the cancellation of, or a reduction in, distributions does not constitute a principal loss absorbency mechanism in accordance with 3B.1(5).
[31/12/2024]

3B.10 The trigger event referred to in 3B.1(5) is significant non-compliance with the SCR. Non-compliance with the SCR is considered significant for these purposes where any of the following conditions is met:
(1) the amount of own funds items eligible to cover the SCR is equal to or less than 75% of the SCR;
(2) the amount of own funds items eligible to cover the MCR is equal to or less than MCR; or
(3) compliance with the SCR is not re-established within a period of three months from the date when non-compliance with the SCR was first observed.
A firm may specify, in the provisions governing the instrument, one or more trigger events in addition to the events referred to in 3B.10(1) to 3B.10(3).
[31/12/2024]

3B.11 For the purposes of 3B.1(4), 3B.1(10) and 3B.1(12), references to the SCR must be read as references to the MCR where non-compliance with the MCR occurs before non-compliance with the SCR.
[31/12/2024]

3B.12 Notwithstanding the requirement in 3B.1(5) for the principal loss absorbency mechanism to be triggered at the trigger event specified in 3B.10, the basic own funds item may provide for the principal loss absorbency mechanism not to be triggered at that event only where this provision is subject to all of the following conditions:
(1) the trigger event occurs in the circumstances described in 3B.10(3);
(2) there have been no previous trigger events in the circumstances described 3B.10(1) or 3B.10(2); and
(3) the firm has received prior permission from the PRA to waive the triggering of the principal loss absorbency mechanism on the basis of the following information:
(a) projections provided to the PRA by the firm when that firm submits the recovery plan required by 4.4(2) of the Group Supervision Part and 3.1(2) of the Undertakings in Difficulty Part, demonstrate that triggering the principal loss absorbency mechanism in that case would be very likely to give rise to a tax liability that would have a significant adverse effect on the firm’s solvency position; and
(b) a certificate issued by the firm’s statutory auditors certifying that all of the assumptions used in the projections are realistic.
[31/12/2024]

3B.13 Notwithstanding the requirement in 3B.1(6)(b), the basic own funds item may allow for repayment or redemption earlier than that period where the following conditions are met:
(1) the firm’s SCR, after the repayment or redemption, will be exceeded by an appropriate margin taking into account the solvency position of the firm, including the firm’s medium-term capital management plan; and
(2) the circumstances are as described in (a) or (b), either;
(a) there is a change in the regulatory classification of the basic own funds item which would be likely to result in its exclusion from the own funds or reclassification as a lower tier of own funds and both of the following conditions are met;
(i) the PRA considers such a change to be sufficiently certain; and
(ii) the firm demonstrates to the satisfaction of the PRA that the regulatory reclassification of the basic own funds item was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of its issuance; or
(b) there is a change in the applicable tax treatment of the basic own funds item which the firm demonstrates to the satisfaction of the PRA:
(i) is material; and
(ii) was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of its issuance.
