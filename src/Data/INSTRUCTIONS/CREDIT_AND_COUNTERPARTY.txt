OF 07.00 - CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS AND FREE DELIVERIES: STANDARDISED APPROACH TO CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (OF CR SA)
Effective from 1 January 2027

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. GENERAL REMARKS & SCOPE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.2.1] General remarks
45. The OF CR SA templates provide the necessary information on the calculation of own funds requirements for credit risk in accordance with the Standardised Approach. In particular, they provide detailed information on:
a) the distribution of the exposure values according to the different, exposure types, risk weights and exposure classes; and
b) the amount and type of credit risk mitigation techniques used.

[3.2.2] Scope of the OF CR SA template (OF 07.00)
46. In accordance with Article 112 of the Credit Risk: Standardised Approach (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook, each SA exposure shall be assigned to one of the SA exposure classes to calculate own funds requirements.
47. The information in OF CR SA is required for the total exposure across all exposure classes and individually for each of the exposure classes under the Standardised Approach. The total figures as well as the information of each exposure class shall be reported in a separate dimension.
48. However the following positions are not within the scope of OF CR SA:
(a) exposures assigned to the exposure class 'items representing securitisation positions' as referred to in Article 112(1)(m) of the Credit Risk: Standardised Approach (CRR) Part, which shall be reported in the CR SEC templates; and
(b) exposures deducted from own funds.
49. The scope of the OF CR SA template shall cover the following own funds requirements:
(a) credit risk in accordance with Credit Risk: Standardised Approach (CRR) Part and Chapter 2 of Title II or Part Three CRR in the banking book, including counterparty credit risk in accordance with the Credit Risk Mitigation (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook and Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook and Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three CRR in the banking book;
(b) counterparty credit risk in accordance with the Credit Risk Mitigation (CRR) Part and Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part and Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three CRR in the trading book for exposures subject to the Standardised Approach in accordance with Credit Risk: Standardised Approach (CRR) Part and Chapter 2 of Title II or Part Three CRR; and
(c) settlement risk arising from free deliveries in accordance with Article 379 CRR in respect of all the business activities.
50. The template shall include all exposures for which own funds requirements are calculated in accordance with Credit Risk: Standardised Approach (CRR) Part and Chapter 2 of Title II and Part Three CRR, including where institutions apply Credit Risk Mitigation (CRR) Part, and Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part and Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three CRR.
50A. Institutions that apply Article 94(1) of the Trading Book (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook shall also report their trading book positions referred to in Article 92(3)(b) of the Required Level of Own Funds (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook in this template when they apply Credit Risk: Standardised Approach (CRR) Part and Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three CRR to calculate the own funds requirements thereof (Credit Risk: Standardised Approach (CRR) Part, Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part and Title V of Part Three CRR). Therefore, the template shall not only provide detailed information on the type of the exposure (e.g. on balance sheet / off balance sheet items), but also information on the allocation of risk weights within the respective exposure class.
51. In addition, OF CR SA includes memorandum items in rows 0300, 0320, 0371, 0372, 0373, 0374 and 0380 to collect further information about: exposures in default; equity exposures within the 'subordinated debt, equity and other own funds instruments' exposure class , and; exposures subject to the currency mismatch multiplier.
52. Those memorandum items in rows 0300 and 0320 shall only be reported for the following exposure classes:
(a) central governments or central banks (Article 112(1)(a));
(b) regional governments or local authorities (Article 112(1)(b));
(c) public sector entities (Article 112(1)(c));
(d) institutions (Article 112(1)(f));
(e) corporates (Article 112(1)(g));
(f) retail (Article 112(1)(h));
(g) real estate (Article 112(1)(i)).
53. The reporting of the memorandum items in rows 0300 and 0320 shall affect neither the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the exposure classes referred to in Article 112(1)(a, b, c, f, g, h) nor the exposure classes referred to in Article 112(1)(i,j) reported in template OF CR SA.
54. The memorandum items in rows 0300 and 0320 provide additional information about the obligor structure of the exposure classes 'in default'. Exposures shall be reported in these rows where the obligors would have been reported in the exposure classes 'Central governments or central banks', 'Regional governments or local authorities', 'Public sector entities', 'Institutions', 'Corporates', 'Retail' and 'Real estate' within OF CR SA, if those exposures were not assigned to the exposure classes 'in default'. The figures reported, however, are the same as used to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts in the exposure class 'exposures in default'.
55. For example, if an exposure, the risk-weighted exposure amounts of which are calculated in accordance with Article 127 and the specific credit risk adjustments are less than 20% of the outstanding amount of the item or facility, then that information shall be reported in OF CR SA, row 0320 in the total and in the exposure class 'in default'. If this exposure, before it defaulted, was an exposure to an institution, then that information shall also be reported in row 0320 of exposure class 'institutions'.
55A. Firms shall only report the memorandum items in rows 0371-0374 for the following exposure class:
(a) subordinated debt, equity and other own funds instruments (Article 112(1)(p)).
55B. Firms shall only report the memorandum items in rows 0371 and 0372 for exposures that are subject to the Rules 4.1 to 4.3 of the Credit Risk: General Provisions (CRR) Part. The reporting of these memorandum items in rows 0371 and 0372 shall not affect the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amount of the exposure class referred to in Article 112(1)(p) reported in template OF CR SA.
55C. Firms shall only report the memorandum items in rows 0373 and 0374 for exposures that are subject to Rules 4.4 to 4.8 of the Credit Risk: General Provisions (CRR) Part. The reporting of these memorandum items in rows 0373 and 0374 shall not affect the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amount of the exposure class referred to in Article 112(1)(p) (which shall include exposures subject to the IRB Transitional Approach described in Rules 4.4 to 4.8 of the Credit Risk: General Provisions (CRR) Part).
55D. The memorandum items in rows 0371-0374 provide additional information on the transitional provisions for the treatment of equity exposures as stated in Rules 4.1 to 4.10 of the Credit Risk: General Provisions (CRR) Part.
55E. Firms shall only report the memorandum item in row 0380 for exposures that are subject to the currency mismatch multiplier as set out in Article 123B. Firms shall only report the memorandum item in row 0380 for the exposure classes stated in Article 112(1)(h) and Article 112(i). The reporting of the memorandum item in row 0375 shall not affect the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amount of the exposure classes referred to in Article 112(1)(h) and Article 112(1)(i) reported in template OF CR SA.

[3.2.3] Assignment of exposures to exposure classes under the SA
56. Firms shall categorise Original exposures pre-conversion factors into the different exposure classes referred to in Article 112(1) and assign these Original exposures pre-conversion factors in the order set out in Article 112(2).
56A. After the Original exposures pre-conversion factors have been assigned to the relevant exposure classes, exposures may be redistributed to other exposure classes due to the application of credit risk mitigation (CRM) in accordance with Credit Risk Mitigation (CRR) Part, via the inflows and outflows columns. As a consequence of CRM where firms apply the risk weight substitution method or the Financial Collateral Simple Method, or apply the Other Funded Credit Protection Method in a way which involves a substitution effect, the covered part of the exposures prior to the application of any applicable conversion factors shall be reallocated to the exposure class of the protection provider.
63. In the case of exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings, and where the look through approach or the mandate-based approach (Article 132A(1-2)) is used, the underlying individual exposure (in the case of the look through approach) and individual group of exposures (in the case of the mandate-based approach) shall be classified into their corresponding risk weight row according to their treatment. However, all the individual exposures shall be classified within the exposure class of Exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings ('CIU').

[3.2.4] Clarifications on specific exposure classes
66. Intra-group exposures referred to in Article 113(6) shall be reported in line with paragraph 68.
68. According to Article 113(6), an institution may, with the prior permission of the PRA, assign a risk weight of 0% to the exposures of that institution to a counterparty which is its parent undertaking, its subsidiary, a subsidiary of its parent undertaking or an undertaking linked by a common management relationship as defined in Article 4(38A) CRR. That means that intra-group counterparties are not necessarily institutions but also undertakings which are assigned to other exposure classes, and therefore shall be reported in the corresponding exposure class.
69. SA exposures shall be assigned to the exposure class 'eligible covered bonds' as follows:
70. Only eligible covered bonds as defined in Articles 129(1) and 129(6) shall be classified in the exposure class 'eligible covered bonds'.
71. Where certain conditions set out in Articles 132A(2) and 132A(3) are met, exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs shall be reported as on balance sheet items in accordance with Article 111(1)(a).

5. BREAKDOWN OF EXPOSURES BY RISK WEIGHTS (ROWS 0140-0280)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Institutions shall report the information on the allocation of risk weights within the respective exposure class according to the Credit Risk: Standardised Approach (CRR) Part and Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three CRR.
Real estate exposures classified as regulatory real estate (residential or commercial) which are not materially dependent on the cash flows generated by the property shall be reported in two parts, against the risk weight applied to the portion up to 55% of the value of the property, and against the portion above 55% of the value of the property (if applicable).
Exposures subject to the currency mismatch multiplier shall be reported against the risk weight which would have applied if the currency mismatch multiplier was not applied. However, the RWEA shall still reflect the currency mismatch multiplier.
Real estate exposures where there are 'charges not held by the institution ranking in priority ahead of the charge that the exposure is secured by' shall be reported against the risk weight which would have applied if Article 124G(2) and Article 124I(3) were disapplied. However, the RWEA shall still reflect the charge priority structure.
Mixed real estate exposures shall be reported against the risk weights for their constituent parts.
Equity exposures (including higher risk equity exposures) in the exposure class 'subordinated debt, equity and other own funds instruments' subject to the transitional provisions in Rules 4.1 to 4.10 of the Credit Risk General Provisions (CRR) Part shall be reported against the risk weights set out in Article 133 disregarding the transitional provisions. However, the RWEA shall still reflect the transitional provisions.
